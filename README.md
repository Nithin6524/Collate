# 🧠 Collate – A Personal Knowledge OS



## 📖 Description

**Collate** is a markdown-based knowledge system that helps you capture write or add notes freely and organize them later with tags, links, and smart filters.  
It is designed for those who struggle to maintain traditional notebooks, want to avoid the chaos of scattered sticky notes, and need a system that grows with their mind — not against it.

Instead of forcing you to think in terms of rigid notebooks or folders, Thoughtbase allows random, unstructured input and organizes it using metadata like tags and links.

## 💡 Motivation

This project was inspired by a real problem:

I jot down random ideas, quick thoughts, or things I learn on small pieces of paper. It's fast and easy, but over time, they pile up, get disorganized, and I forget where I wrote what. I can't keep a formal notebook because I write about random topics at random times. What I need is a way to write freely, but still be able to find and remember what I wrote later.

**Collate** is designed to solve exactly that:
- Capture information fast, without worrying about structure
- Organize and retrieve thoughts easily using tags and search
- Make your notes more useful over time through linking and scheduled review

It’s your **second brain**, but built your way.
